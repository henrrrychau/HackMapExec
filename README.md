# HackMapExec: The personally maintained version of CrackMapExec

HackMapExec is a personally maintained version of CrackMapExec which has been archived due to hostile branches.
I maintain this for the practice of red team weapon customization.

For memorial, the original description of CrackMapExec will be preserved below. All the changes will be based on the original work.
